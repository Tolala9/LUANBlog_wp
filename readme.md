# LUANBlog 

That's my Blog for the portfolio. That's not a commercial work. Only for practice in new technology and design. 

## Description

That's Blog made for storing my working notes as a post for the more interesting method to review learning materials. Where I can easily add a post to a relevant category and where I can make more different content with pictures, code blocks, quotes, list, videos, links, and etc. That's why source code was injected into popular [CMS WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), but the appropriate logic for some features wrote on PHP and JS.
